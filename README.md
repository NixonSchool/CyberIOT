**Forums:** Discuss about IoT. A mosh pit for tech nerds. Based on Django Machina, but with a CyberIOT twist that's spicier than your grandma's firewall.

**IoT Marketplace:** Buy and sell gadgets. Finally, a place to get those toasters that make tweets! It's like Amazon, but for people who want to sell their cutting-edge IoT gadgets or buy that Wi-Fi enabled toaster they never knew they needed!

**LearningHub:** Watch videos about IoT. A simpler YouTube for IOT-geeks! Upload videos of yourself hacking a coffee maker or watch tutorials. Knowledge is power, and power is voltage divided by current!

**VulnerabilitiesHub:** Found a bug? Report it here! Tell us about all of it in depth. It's like a confessional booth for white-hat hackers. "Forgive me, admin, for I have stumbled upon a zero-day exploit and I do not desire to use it for harm, so take they exploit and report it, but will I get paid?"

**Vulnerability Tracking:** Fixed IOT vulnerabilities news, part cybersecurity news, part personal blog. Read about the latest patched vulnerabilities or Bob's journey to grow the perfect digital tomato. It's a weird mix, but hey, so is IoT!

CyberIOT: Where we connect people who connect everything else!

How to run the project:

Load your project in your preferred IDE.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34345679-550e-4800-b5d5-5e2fc875a23b)

Ensure you're exactly inside the project folder. You're where the manage.py is located. If you're not in that folder, change directory into there.

Create a virtual environment.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d74c433-f3b5-4a2f-bd2b-9211dc864268)

You can name it as you like, eg myenv can also be python -m venv venv // python -m venv env // python -m venv my_custom_env_name (that's up to you).

Once the venv is created, it will appear over there as a folder. 

Activate the virtual environment(venv):

On MacOS and linux:

It will reflect in your terminal.

Install django on your main computer using pip:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e9fe40a-729e-4a15-a071-5c3c303ee9be)

Then come back and install the requirements.txt, it will take lots of time and also if you're using pycharm, indexing can take around 10 to 20 minutes:

You don't need to do migrations, unless you've changed the tables structures:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25821ea9-a982-4237-af8f-64baef53d3c4)

The project has an sqlite database with migrations already done, so you don't need to setup anything else.

Optional: Create another superuser, ensure you're in venv before you create the superadmin:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3721d020-2315-4f2b-8145-fcdfef3c7e62)

Every user's username and password is: username || ghoster123@@#

Registered users (Visit the chat app search functionality to see all users listed).

Just type their name or their email and the password.

Current's superadmin username and password is: cyberiot || ghoster123@@#@@#

For pycharm users, ensure that you've configured you server properly, else the project won't work.

Ensure python is well installed and added to path on your main computer. And django is installed too. Then you can enter pycharm and configure the server in settings.
