Welcome to CyberIOT: Where Smart Devices Come to Party!

Forums: Discuss about IoT. It's like a coffee shop, but your coffee maker might join the conversation. a mosh pit for tech nerds. Based on Django Machina, but with a CyberIOT twist that's spicier than your grandma's firewall.

IoT Marketplace: Buy and sell gadgets. Finally, a place to get those toasters that make tweets! It's like Amazon, but for people who want to sell their cutting-edge IoT gadgets or buy that Wi-Fi enabled toaster they never knew they needed!

LearningHub: Watch videos about IoT. A simpler YouTube for IOT-geeks! Upload videos of yourself hacking a coffee maker or watch tutorials. Knowledge is power, and power is voltage divided by current!

VulnerabilitiesHub: Found a bug? Report it here! Tell us about all of it in depth. It's like a confessional booth for white-hat hackers. "Forgive me, admin, for I have stumbled upon a zero-day exploit and I do not desire to use it for harm, so take they exploit and report it, but will I get paid?"


Vulnerability Tracking: Fixed IOT vulnerabilities news, part cybersecurity news, part personal blog. Read about the latest patched vulnerabilities or Bob's journey to grow the perfect digital tomato. It's a weird mix, but hey, so is IoT!
